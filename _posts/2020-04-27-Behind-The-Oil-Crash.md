## What Happened? 

On April 20th, 2020, the front-month WTI crude contract crashed by 37%, making WTI future contracts collapse to negative prices for the first time in history. The May contracts were being sold for $-37.63 a barrel, which is the lowest level since NYMEX opened oil futures trading in 1983. Contracts for June delivery are down 36.6%, at $15.54 a barrel. Brent futures are also down significantly; the May contract is down 13.8% to $21.44 a barrel and the July contract is down 15.8% to $24.81 a barrel. This confirms that the US is running out of storage at Cushing, Oklahoma, where WTI futures contracts need to be physically delivered to, while Brent is deliverable offshore. This storage running out means that companies have to seek alternatives to store oil such as on oil tankers, but even that is getting filled quickly. This shortage of space is so extreme that they would in theory “pay you to take a barrel of oil”, hence the negative price. 

Due to the coronavirus pandemic, the demand for oil has gone down by 30 million barrels per day, already down 30% of the average daily oil consumption pre-pandemic. Members of OPEC have already agreed to cut their oil by 9.7 million barrels on April 13 2020 in efforts to stabilize the results of COVID-19 and the Oil Price War between Saudi Arabia and Russia which started back in March. Goldman Sachs analysts commented that this was far too late of an agreement and April 20’s oil crash proved so. 

Previously, experts said that the economy will recover quickly once it is reopened and thus anticipating a V shaped recession. This is most likely not the case anymore as oil prices can be used as a proxy for the health of the global economy, and oil prices are very sickly today. We can perhaps have more of a chance of seeing a U shaped recession now. The global pandemic was far from over and the moment the restrictions are relaxed, the infection count may rise again. Oil prices lag behind the economy and even if the economy recovers quickly, the effects of the Oil Price War will still show. We can expect at the earliest, oil prices will recover in the second quarter, but don’t be surprised if it takes all the way to Q4 for oil prices to show promise. 

## Analysis

Regardless, I do feel that there still are opportunities in the energy market today. Natural gas rose by 3% on April 20th for instance and corporations for gathering and processing the said commodities are excelling. The excess supply of oil is taking off weight for natural gas, giving a slim potential for growth opportunity, in comparison to oil which is directly on the decline. Historically, the 2 commodities moved in tandem but the shale revolution in 2011 ruined this relationship through cheaper prices as well as a supply changeup. Since then, the 2 prices move in their own ways, which is characterized by the 2019 US Crude Oil & Natural Gas prices:

This trend that I am proposing, is definitely something to watch out for. I took a further look at the last oil crash, which was 2014-2016. The biggest difference was that the price drop was gradual. This 70% drop was due to supply issues, which is very much like the issue that we are dealing with today. This recovered a year later but with significant decrease in investment towards the industry. Since then, price has never been over $76. Based on these historical trends, I would really expect for oil prices to stay quite low after the resumption of the economy. 
The final thought that I would like to consider is the additional struggles that businesses may be enduring. As oil corporations have already suffered greatly due to the Oil Price War back in March, we are now in unchartered territory. If we can learn from the past, we know that back in 1998 when oil prices hit record lows, there was increased M&A activity in the energy space. A noticeable one would be Exxon Corporation’s acquisition of Mobil Corporation to create the ExxonMobil that we know today. Economic crises like this are big opportunities for activities in Private Equity and M&A fields. This could be held back a little; the entire oil industry has fallen out of favor (deservingly so) due to the many oil conflicts that have happened throughout the years. Investors are nowadays reluctant to get involved in this sector because of both its volatility and its unsustainability. Regardless, to those seeking an oil company acquisition, this is the time.
Opportunities definitely still exist amidst this oil crash, and it is up to us to discover alternatives and ideas since it is very likely that this won’t recover anytime soon. In many spaces there are still opportunities. When a door closes, another opens.
