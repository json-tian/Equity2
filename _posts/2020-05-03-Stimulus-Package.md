## Quick Throw Back

Just last month, the US federal government announced to issue a $2 trillion stimulus package to help the recession caused by the pandemic, COVID-19. Some may be wondering how much is $2 trillion and so let’s have a small comparison. This stimulus package is approximately 2.5x bigger than the stimulus issued in 2008 and it’s approximately as huge as the GDP of G7 countries like Canada and Italy. 

The distribution of the $2 trillion stimulus package goes as: 

  * Individuals earning up to $75k: $900 billion
  * Small businesses: $350 billion
  * Big businesses: $425 billion 
  * Bailout for Industries in need such as airlines: $75 billion 
  * Healthcare: $100 billion

## Current Update

While all of this seems a lot, the US government expects to increase this deficit to $3.7 trillion according to various sources such as Bloomberg, Reuters, The Balance, etc. Recently on Monday April 30, 2020, another $321 billion dollars for small businesses, thus contributing to the estimated $3.7 trillion deficit expectation. Apparently, the $350 billion from the $2 trillion dollar stimulus package for small businesses quickly ran out since many not-so-small businesses claimed too much loans, leaving nothing for the small businesses. Hence, this causes the Congress to add another $321 billion for Paycheck Protection Program loans (PPP) so that small businesses can keep workers employed. 

## Analysis

Back to the main topic: should the debt be worrisome? To examine this issue, we have to first understand the methods of stimulus and then look at the consequences of these debts incurred. How does the US government constantly supply stimulus packages to help defend against this recession? 

1. Fiscal Stimulus: 
   - The US government offers treasury securities or issues government bonds to raise money. Given the US is an economic superpower, having great economic resources and the greenbag is the world’s most used currency, the risks of normal citizens lending government money by purchasing these securities are pretty low. The two main risks for this method are high debt-to-GDP ratio (currently sitting at 110%) and consumers hoarding cash instead of spending it during a recession. The first reason is worrisome because the US government might default on their repayments but due to the help monetary policy, strong influence of greenbag and having most debt owed by US citizens, this issue is not unsolvable to the extent like Greece. The latter is more worrisome since if consumers don’t spend, the purpose of a stimulus is defeated, causing the economy not being able to walk out of recession.
   - The second fiscal stimulus involves tax rebates. By sacrificing some government revenues, hence enlarging the government deficit, the US federal government has chosen to return some taxes paid in order to boost disposable income. This action hopes to stimulate some consumer spending to keep the economy running. Just like the previous point, the risks of this is if consumers choose to hoard cash in fear of spending or not having enough money in the future, this solution would not be as effective as the theory states.  
2. Monetary Stimulus:
   - Central Banks have decreased the interest rates to boost the economy's cash circulation. With lower interest rates and stabilization of the financial market, the cost of borrowing has significantly reduced, causing more incentives for businesses and people to take loans. With an increase of borrowing, the circulation of money will increase since there is less incentive to save given the interest rates are low. At the same time, a low interest rate economy causes exports to increase due to weakened exchange rates. This will cause more money to enter the economy and drive the economy back up. 
   - The Fed has also used quantitative easing. Quantitative easing is when the central bank purchases large amounts of financial assets such as bonds from financial institutions in order to boost reserves of banks. This will result in an abundance of money supply, drive up security prices and lower interest rates, thus reaching the same goal as the first solution of monetary stimulus. The risks to both of these solutions are of course inflation but again, given greenbag being the most circulated currency in the world, this risk poses less of a threat to the US compared to a country like Venezuela.

Either stimulation is actually necessary for the current market to prevent huge economic troughs. The effects of debt-financed government spending and quantitative easing, although provides some security for consumers and investors at the current moment, is gradually derailing the reality of financial market from the expected theoretical fundamentals that financial analysts are expecting. For example, industries like airlines and tourism are expected to receive a massive hit from this COVID-19 shutdown but thanks to the stimulus, they are still surviving. Just like how a person cannot keep on borrowing on a micro level, the government will eventually need to repay its debts. When the economy returns to its track, the government will be cutting expenditures on social services, raising tax rates, and perhaps printing more money just to repay the debt, all of which can slow and make the growth of the economy back to its peak counter-productive. Due to the derailment from fundamental theories and the need of repaying debt, we should expect more market volatility in the near future. 

## Conclusion

Are these stimulus packages really that helpful? Is quantitative easing useful, harmful or a double edge sword? Will the economy perform better with the help of massive government spending? The truth is we do not know. Despite the theory of Keynesian economics and Quantitative Easing stated that the impact of recession can be lowered through these stimulus methods, it is after all still a relatively new concept that’s discovered in the 1930s and 2008 respectively. Let’s let the market depict its usefulness.
