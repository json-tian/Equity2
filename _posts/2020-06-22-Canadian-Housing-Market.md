### Canadian Housing Market

The Canadian housing market has been a major topic of discussion for the last couple of years, as house prices across the country have been steadily rising since the 2008 global financial crisis shook the world economy. While some have theorized the price climb as being indicative of a bubble, many Canadians have purchased properties as investments. 

However, since COVID-19 was recognized as a global pandemic, the Canadian housing market has taken a hit. In Toronto, house sales dropped by over 66% from March (though sales have begun to rebound as lockdown restrictions loosen) while average home prices dropped by 12%. This is largely in part due to the drop in housing demand, seeing as over 2 million Canadians have lost their jobs since March and subsequently, their source of income. [1]

As the beginning of June marks the 6th month of a tragic 2020, the Canadian housing market faces a long, arduous path back to pre-COVID levels. Perhaps more importantly however, lies the issue of defaults on mortgages and HELOCs (home equity lines of credit), both of which are collateralized by real estate assets. 

In this article, I will be discussing the implications of a defaulting crisis and what it could mean for Canadians. 



## Where Things Stand

The CMHC (Canadian Mortgage and Housing Corporation) recently published reports regarding housing market outlooks and forecasts. The CMHC does not expect a Canada-wide rebound in prices until the first half of 2021, with prices expected to decline 9%-18% from pre-COVID levels. In Ontario, average housing prices could reach pre-COVID levels (~$660,000) by mid 2022, though a massive decline to 2018 levels (~$560,000) also remains a possibility. Forecasts for British Columbia are less hopeful, as prices are forecasted to remain in the range of ~$620,000 (well below 2018 levels) - ~$700,000 (mid 2019 levels) halfway through 2022. [2]

With regards to credit, the CMHC’s most recent mortgage and consumer credit report was released for Q2 2019. As of Q2 2019, Canadian households hold a total of $1.934 trillion in credit (we can expect this to have grown by 3%-5% in Q2 2020 as indicated by the CMHC). Of this total amount, 77.2% is composed of mortgages and HELOCs. As previously mentioned, both mortgages and HELOCs hold the underlying property as collateralized debt, meaning that through a default, the lender typically recoups their losses through the sale of the underlying asset. [3]

### Implications

The main issue arises due to factors stemming from the current environment induced by COVID-19. Record high levels of unemployment restrict sources of income for Canadians, thus fueling the rate of defaults. If housing prices fall below the amount lent, then the lender records a loss on the loan, some of which is partly insured by the CMHC and some private companies. Furthermore, if all banks simultaneously engage in power of sale on collateralized homes, the large increase in home supply could see house prices drop substantially. 

Losses are already becoming somewhat evident, given that Canada’s big 6 banks have set aside $8.3 billion in loan loss provisions for the combined months of May, June and July alone [4]. The possibility of a 2nd COVID-19 wave could make matters far worse, as banks would record devastating losses and would subsequently begin cutting costs through employee turnover, further agitating the unemployment rate and tanking bank equities. 

### Conclusion

Only as time passes can we indicate the severity of COVID-19’s impact on unemployment and the Canadian housing market. As things currently stand, banks are prepared for the impact on mortgage defaults, though this could very easily shift in the coming months, with the potential of a 2nd wave causing far more problems for the economy.
